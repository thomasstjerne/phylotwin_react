# PhyloNext v2 web-GUI documentation

## 1. Introduction

PhyloNext v2 provides a user-friendly web interface for the PhyloTwin biodiversity analysis pipeline. It is an advanced modelling tool designed to calculate and visualize biodiversity metrics, particularly focusing on phylogenetic diversity, using global and dynamic data sources.

Traditional biodiversity measures often rely on taxonomic richness (species counts). However, PhyloNext emphasizes **phylogenetic diversity**, which considers the evolutionary relationships between species, offering a more comprehensive view crucial for effective conservation planning and biodiversity management. This tool aims to facilitate researchers, monitoring initiatives, policy-makers, and the public in understanding and managing biodiversity.

The PhyloNext interface leverages global species occurrence database provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and synthetic phylogenetic trees from the Open Tree of Life (OToL).

The GUI is hosted at GBIF.org: [https://phylonext.gbif.org/](https://phylonext.gbif.org/)
A GBIF.org user account is required: [Create account](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile).
